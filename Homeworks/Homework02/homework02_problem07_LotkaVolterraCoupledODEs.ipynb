    "\n",
    "This problem demonstrates that numerical solutions of nonlinear, coupled ODE systems can behave very differently from the exact solution if the time step or numerical method is not chosen carefully. Even when the true dynamics consist of regular, closed oscillations, a numerical method may introduce artificial growth, damping, or drift that accumulates over long times. By comparing Forward Euler and the Explicit Midpoint method, we see that higher-order methods can better capture qualitative features of the dynamics at larger step sizes, though they may still fail to preserve important invariants exactly. Overall, this example highlights the importance of both step-size selection and method choice when simulating nonlinear systems over long time intervals.\n"
